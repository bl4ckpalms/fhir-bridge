# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FHIR Bridge is a cloud-hosted, zero-trust gateway designed to facilitate healthcare interoperability by transforming HL7 v2 messages to FHIR R4 format and managing consent for TEFCA (Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement) compliance. This system serves as a critical integration point between legacy Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and modern healthcare standards, enabling secure and compliant data exchange across healthcare organizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare system administrator, I want to send HL7 v2 messages through the FHIR bridge, so that they are automatically converted to FHIR R4 format for modern system compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HL7 v2 message is received THEN the system SHALL validate the message format and structure
2. WHEN a valid HL7 v2 message is processed THEN the system SHALL transform it to FHIR R4 format according to standard mapping rules
3. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN the system SHALL return the FHIR R4 resource with appropriate metadata
4. IF an HL7 v2 message is malformed THEN the system SHALL return a detailed error response with validation issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare data exchange participant, I want all data transfers to be secured through zero-trust architecture, so that patient data remains protected throughout the transmission process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any request is made to the system THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize the request before processing
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL encrypt all communications using TLS 1.3 or higher
3. WHEN accessing system resources THEN the system SHALL verify identity and permissions for each request
4. WHEN logging access attempts THEN the system SHALL record all authentication and authorization events for audit purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a TEFCA network participant, I want consent management capabilities integrated into the bridge, so that patient consent preferences are respected during data exchange.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a data request THEN the system SHALL check for valid patient consent before proceeding
2. WHEN consent is not found or expired THEN the system SHALL block the data exchange and return an appropriate error
3. WHEN consent preferences specify data restrictions THEN the system SHALL filter the response according to those restrictions
4. WHEN consent status changes THEN the system SHALL update the consent registry and apply changes to future requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an EHR system integrator, I want standardized APIs for connecting different healthcare systems, so that integration complexity is minimized across various platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with the bridge THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful APIs following FHIR R4 specifications
2. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
3. WHEN different EHR systems connect THEN the system SHALL support multiple authentication methods (OAuth 2.0, API keys, certificates)
4. WHEN API versioning is required THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for at least two major versions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a healthcare compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit logging and monitoring, so that all data exchanges can be tracked for regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any data transformation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the source, destination, timestamp, and transformation details
2. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with sufficient information for troubleshooting
3. WHEN audit reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate compliance reports showing all data exchange activities
4. WHEN monitoring alerts are configured THEN the system SHALL notify administrators of system health issues or security events

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cloud infrastructure administrator, I want the system to be scalable and highly available, so that it can handle varying loads and maintain service continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale resources to maintain performance
2. WHEN a component fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating through redundant components
3. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments
4. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL restore service within defined RTO/RPO objectives
