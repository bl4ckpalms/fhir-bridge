## Integration with Test Framework

### Loading Test Data
```java
// Load authorization scenarios
List<ConsentRecord> authScenarios = TestDataLoader.loadConsentRecords("authorization-test-scenarios.json");

// Load role-based scenarios
List<ConsentRecord> roleScenarios = TestDataLoader.loadConsentRecords("role-based-authorization-scenarios.json");

// Load TEFCA scenarios
List<ConsentRecord> tefcaScenarios = TestDataLoader.loadConsentRecords("tefca-interoperability-scenarios.json");
```

### Test Scenario Selection
```java
// Get emergency access scenarios
List<ConsentRecord> emergencyScenarios = authScenarios.stream()
    .filter(c -> c.isEmergencyOverride())
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Get role-based scenarios for specific role
List<ConsentRecord> physicianScenarios = roleScenarios.stream()
    .filter(c -> c.getAuthorizedRoles().contains("ATTENDING_PHYSICIAN"))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Get TEFCA-compliant scenarios
List<ConsentRecord> tefcaCompliantScenarios = tefcaScenarios.stream()
    .filter(ConsentRecord::isTefcaCompliant)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## Maintenance and Updates

### Adding New Scenarios
1. Identify the appropriate file based on scenario type
2. Follow the existing JSON structure and naming conventions
3. Include comprehensive description and relevant attributes
4. Update this summary document with new scenario details
5. Add corresponding test cases to validate the new scenarios

### Scenario Validation
- All scenarios should be realistic and based on actual healthcare use cases
- Consent records must maintain referential integrity with patient and organization data
- Special attributes should be documented and supported by the application logic
- Compliance requirements should be accurately reflected in the consent terms
