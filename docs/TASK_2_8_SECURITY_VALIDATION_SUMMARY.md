  - Auditor role with read-only access

- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - JWT token-based authentication
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - Session management with 30-minute timeout
  - Password policies and complexity requirements

### 5. Audit Trail Verification ✅
- **Comprehensive Logging**:
  - Authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
  - Authorization events (access attempts, permission changes)
  - Data access events (PHI access, modifications, deletions)
  - System events (configuration changes, security incidents)
  - Consent events (creation, modification, revocation)

- **Log Management**:
  - 6+ year retention for HIPAA compliance
  - Tamper-resistant storage with digital signatures
  - Real-time monitoring for suspicious activities
  - CloudWatch Logs integration with S3 archival

### 6. HIPAA Compliance Documentation ✅
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: `docs/HIPAA_SECURITY_CONTROLS.md`
- **Administrative Safeguards**: Security officer, training, access management
- **Physical Safeguards**: Facility access, workstation use, device controls
- **Technical Safeguards**: Access control, audit, integrity, authentication, transmission security
- **Breach Notification**: Detection, assessment, notification procedures
- **Business Associate Agreements**: Third-party compliance management

## Security Validation Tools
